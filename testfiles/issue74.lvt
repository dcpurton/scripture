\begin{scripture}[John 1:1--2]
  \ch{1}In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
  was God. \vs{2}He was with God in the beginning. \vs{3}Through him all
  things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. \vs{4}In
  him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. \vs{5}The light
  shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

  \vs{6}There was a man sent from God whose name was John.

\begin{scripture}[Isaiah 5:1--2]
  \begin{poetry}
    \ch{5}I will sing for the one I love
    a song about his vineyard:

    my loved one had a vineyard
    on a fertile hillside.

    \vs{2}He dug it up and cleared it of stones
    and planted it with the choicest vines.

    He built a watchtower in it
    and cut out a winepress as well.

    Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,
    but it yielded only bad fruit.

    \vs{6}You, \name{Lord}, have abandoned your people,

    and embrace pagan customs.

    \vs{31}So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the
    glory of God. \vs{32}Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks
    or the church of God---\vs{33}even as I try to please everyone in every
    way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they
    may be saved. \ch{11}Follow my example, as I follow the example of
    Christ.

    \ch{1}In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. \vs{2}Now the
