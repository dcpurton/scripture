      \vs{1}O \name{Lord}, how many are my foes!
      How many rise up against me!

      “God will not deliver him.”\selah

      \vs{3}But you are a shield around me, O \name{Lord};
      you bestow glory on me and lift up my head.

      \vs{4}To the \name{Lord} I cry aloud,
      and he answers me from his holy hill.\selah
