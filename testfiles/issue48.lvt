\begin{scripture}[Romans 11:33--36]
  \vs{33}O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How
  unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!

  \begin{poetry}
    \vs{34}“For who has known the mind of the Lord?
    Or who has been his counselor?”

    \vs{35}“Or who has given a gift to him,
    to receive a gift in return?”
  \end{poetry}
  \vs{36}For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the
  glory forever. Amen.
