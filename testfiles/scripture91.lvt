\begin{scripture}[Hosea 11:12--12:1]
  \begin{poetry}
    \vs{12}Ephraim has surrounded me with lies,
    and the house of Israel with deceit;

    but Judah still walks with God,
    and is faithful to the Holy One.

    \ch{12}Ephraim herds the wind,
    and pursues the east wind all day long;

    they multiply falsehood and violence;
    they make a treaty with Assyria,
    and oil is carried to Egypt.
