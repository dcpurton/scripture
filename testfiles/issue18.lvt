\begin{scripture}[Romans 9:13--16][noindent]
  \nofirstverse\vs{13}As it is written,
  \begin{poetry}
    “I have loved Jacob,
    but I have hated Esau.”
  \end{poetry}

  \vs{14}What then are we to say? Is there injustice on God’s part? By no
  means! \vs{15}For he says to Moses,

  \begin{poetry}
    “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,
    and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
  \end{poetry}
  \vs{16}So it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God who shows
  mercy.
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}[Romans 11:33--36]
  \vs{33}O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How
  unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!

  \begin{poetry}
    \vs{34}“For who has known the mind of the Lord?
    Or who has been his counselor?”

    \vs{35}“Or who has given a gift to him,
    to receive a gift in return?”
  \end{poetry}
  \vs{36}For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the
  glory forever. Amen.
