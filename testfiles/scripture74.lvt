  \begin{scripture}[John 3:1--3]
    \ch{3}Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of
    the Jewish ruling council. \vs{2}He came to Jesus at night and said,
    ‘Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one
    could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.’

    \vs{3}Jesus replied, ‘Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of
    God unless they are born again.’
