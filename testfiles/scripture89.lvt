\begin{scripture}
  \vs{40}A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, ‘If you
  are willing, you can make me clean.’

  \vs{41}Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. ‘I
  am willing,’ he said. ‘Be clean!’ \vs{42}Immediately the leprosy left him and
  he was cleansed.

  \vs{43}Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: \vs{44}‘See that
  you don’t tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer
  the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to
  them.’ \vs{45}Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the
  news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed
  outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.

  \ch{2}A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard
  that he had come home. \vs{2}They gathered in such large numbers that there
  was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to
  them. \vs{3}Some men came, bringing to him a paralysed man, carried by four
  of them. \vs{4}Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd,
  they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then
  lowered the mat the man was lying on. \vs{5}When Jesus saw their faith, he
  said to the paralysed man, ‘Son, your sins are forgiven.’

  \vs{6}Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to
  themselves, \vs{7}‘Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who
  can forgive sins but God alone?’

  \vs{8}Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were
  thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, ‘Why are you thinking these
  things? \vs{9}Which is easier: to say to this paralysed man, “Your sins are
  forgiven,” or to say, “Get up, take your mat and walk”? \vs{10}But I want you
  to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.’ So he
  said to the man, \vs{11}‘I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.’
  \vs{12}He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This
  amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, ‘We have never seen anything
  like this!’
