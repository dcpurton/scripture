\begin{scripture}[John 1:1--2]
  \ch{1}In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
  was God. \vs{2}He was with God in the beginning.
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}[John 3:16--17]
  \vs{16}For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
  whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. \vs{17}For
  God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save
  the world through him.

\begin{scripture}[Isaiah 5:1--2]
  \begin{poetry}
    \ch{5}I will sing for the one I love
    a song about his vineyard:

    my loved one had a vineyard
    on a fertile hillside.

    \vs{2}He dug it up and cleared it of stones
    and planted it with the choicest vines.

    He built a watchtower in it
    and cut out a winepress as well.

    Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,
    but it yielded only bad fruit.
  \end{poetry}
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}[Isaiah 1:2--3]
  \begin{poetry}
    \vs{2}Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth!
    For the \name{Lord} has spoken:

    ‘I reared children and brought them up,
    but they have rebelled against me.

    \vs{3}The ox knows its master,
    the donkey its owner’s manger,

    but Israel does not know,
    my people do not understand.’
  \end{poetry}
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}[1 Corinthians 10:31--11:1]
  \begin{midparachap}
    \vs{31}So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the
    glory of God. \vs{32}Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks
    or the church of God---\vs{33}even as I try to please everyone in every
    way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they
    may be saved. \ch{11}Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.

\begin{scripture}[Genesis 1:1--2]
  \begin{hanging}
    \ch{1}In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. \vs{2}Now the
    earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep,
    and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
  \end{hanging}
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}[Genesis 1:3--5]
  \begin{hanging}
    \vs{3}And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. \vs{4}God
    saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
    \vs{5}God called the light ‘day’, and the darkness he called ‘night’. And
    there was evening, and there was morn\-ing---the first day.
