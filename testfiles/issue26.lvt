\begin{scripture}[Acts 12:25--13:5]
  \begin{midparachap}
    \vs{25}When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned
    from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark. \ch{13}Now
    in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas,
    Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up
    with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. \vs{2}While they were worshipping the
    Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, ‘Set apart for me Barnabas and
    Saul for the work to which I have called them.’ \vs{3}So after they had
    fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them
    off.
  \end{midparachap}

  \vs{4}The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to
  Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. \vs{5}When they arrived at
  Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was
  with them as their helper.

    that you would never believe,

  them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.

  \vs{27}Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and
