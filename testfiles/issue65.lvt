\begin{scripture}[1 Corinthians 10:27--11:1]
  \vs{27}If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat
  whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience.
  \vs{28}But if someone says to you, ‘This has been offered in sacrifice,’
  then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the
  sake of conscience. \vs{29}I am referring to the other person’s conscience,
  not yours. For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience?
  \vs{30}If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced
  because of something I thank God for?

  \begin{midparachap}
    \vs{31}So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the
    glory of God. \vs{32}Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks
    or the church of God---\vs{33}even as I try to please everyone in every
    way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they
    may be saved. \ch{11}Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.
  \end{midparachap}
