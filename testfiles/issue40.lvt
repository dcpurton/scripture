  \ch{2}A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard
  that he had come home. \vs{2}They gathered in such large numbers that there
  was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to
  them.

  \begin{poetry}
    \ch{5}I will sing for the one I love
    a song about his vineyard:

    my loved one had a vineyard
    on a fertile hillside.

    \vs{2}He dug it up and cleared it of stones
    and planted it with the choicest vines.

    He built a watchtower in it
    and cut out a winepress as well.

    Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,
    but it yielded only bad fruit.

  \begin{hanging}
    \ch{1}In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. \vs{2}Now the
    earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep,
    and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

\begin{scripture}[John 5:19--20][redletter]
  \vs{19}Jesus gave them this answer: \redletteron â€˜Very truly I tell you, the
  Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing,
  because whatever the Father does the Son also does. \vs{20}For the Father
  loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even
  greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.
