  \begin{poetry}
    \ch{40}Comfort, comfort my people,
    says your God.

    \vs{2}Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
    and proclaim to her

    that her hard service has been completed,
    that her sin has been paid for,

    that she has received from the \name{Lord}’s hand
    double for all her sins.

    \vs{3}A voice of one calling:

    “In the wilderness prepare
    the way for the \name{Lord};

    make straight in the desert
    a highway for our God.
