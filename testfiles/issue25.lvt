    \vs{25}When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned
    from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark. \ch{13}Now
    in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas,
    Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up
    with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. \vs{2}While they were worshipping the
    Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, ‘Set apart for me Barnabas and
    Saul for the work to which I have called them.’ \vs{3}So after they had
    fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them
    off.
  \end{midparachap}

  \vs{4}The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to
  Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. \vs{5}When they arrived at
  Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was
  with them as their helper.
