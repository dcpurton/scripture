    \vs{3}And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. \vs{4}God
    saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
    \vs{5}God called the light ‘day’, and the darkness he called ‘night’. And
    there was evening, and there was morn\-ing---the first day.

    \vs{6}And God said, ‘Let there be a vault between the waters to separate
    water from water.’ \vs{7}So God made the vault and separated the water
    under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. \vs{8}God called
    the vault ‘sky’. And there was evening, and there was morn\-ing---the
    second day.
