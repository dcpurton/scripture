  \ch{6}In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted,
  seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple. \vs{2}Above
  him were seraphim, each with six wings: with two wings they covered their
  faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
