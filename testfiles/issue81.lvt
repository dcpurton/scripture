\begin{scripture}[John 6:7--11]
  \vs{7}Philip answered him, ‘It would take more than half a year’s wages to
  buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!’

  \vs{8}Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up,
  \vs{9}‘Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but
  how far will they go among so many?’

  \vs{10}Jesus said, ‘Make the people sit down.’ There was plenty of grass in
  that place, and they sat down (about five thousand men were there).
  \vs{11}Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who
  were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.

\begin{scripture}[Hebrews 5:5--10]
  \vs{5}In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming
  a high priest. But God said to him,
  \begin{poetry}
    ‘You are my Son;
    today I have become your Father.’
  \end{poetry}
  \vs{6}And he says in another place,
  \begin{poetry}
    ‘You are a priest for ever,
    in the order of Melchizedek.’
  \end{poetry}

  \vs{7}During the days of Jesus’ life on earth, he offered up prayers and
  petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from
  death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. \vs{8}Son though
  he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered \vs{9}and, once made
  perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him
  \vs{10}and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of
  Melchizedek.
