\begin{scripture}[John 3:16--21]
  \vs{16}For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
  whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. \vs{17}For
  God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the
  world through him. \vs{18}Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but
  whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not
  believed in the name of Godâ€™s one and only Son. \vs{19}This is the verdict:
  light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light
  because their deeds were evil. \vs{20}Everyone who does evil hates the light,
  and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.
  \vs{21}But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be
  seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.
