    \newvs And God said, ‘Let the land produce living creatures according to
    their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and
    the wild animals, each according to its kind.’ And it was so. \newvs God
    made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to
    their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to
    their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

    \nohang\newvs Then God said, ‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our
    likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in
    the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the
    creatures that move along the ground.’
  \end{hanging}

  \begin{poetry}
    \newvs So God created mankind in his own image,
    in the image of God he created them;
    male and female he created them.
  \end{poetry}

  \begin{hanging}
    \nohang\newvs God blessed them and said to them, ‘Be fruitful and increase
    in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and
    the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the
    ground.’

    \nohang\newvs Then God said, ‘I give you every seed-bearing plant on the
    face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it.
    They will be yours for food. \newvs And to all the beasts of the earth and
    all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground
    – everything that has the breath of life in it – I give every green plant
    for food.’ And it was so.

    \nohang\newvs God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And
    there was evening, and there was morning – the sixth day.

    \newch Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast
    array.

    \newvs By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so
    on the seventh day he rested from all his work. \newvs Then God blessed
    the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the
    work of creating that he had done.
  \end{hanging}

  \newvs This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were
  created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.

  \newvs Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet
  sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no
  one to work the ground, \newvs but streams came up from the earth and
  watered the whole surface of the ground. \newvs Then the Lord God formed a
  man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of
  life, and the man became a living being.
