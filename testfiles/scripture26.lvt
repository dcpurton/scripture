    \ch{1}In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. \vs{2}Now the
    earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep,
    and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

    \vs{3}And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. \vs{4}God
    saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
    \vs{5}God called the light ‘day’, and the darkness he called ‘night’. And
    there was evening, and there was morn\-ing---the first day.
