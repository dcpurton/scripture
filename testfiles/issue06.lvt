\begin{scripture}[Hosea 11:12--12:1]
  \begin{poetry}
    \vs{12}Ephraim has surrounded me with lies,
    Israel with deceit.

    And Judah is unruly against God,
    even against the faithful Holy One.

    \ch{12}Ephraim feeds on the wind;
    he pursues the east wind all day
    and multiplies lies and violence.

    He makes a treaty with Assyria
    and sends olive oil to Egypt.
