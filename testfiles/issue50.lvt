    When I would restore the fortunes of my people,
    \ch{7}when I would heal Israel,
    the corruption of Ephraim is revealed,
    and the wicked deeds of Samaria;

    for they deal falsely,
    the thief breaks in,
    and the bandits raid outside.

    \vs{2}But they do not consider
    that I remember all their wickedness.

    Now their deeds surround them;
    they are before my face.

    the sins of Ephraim are exposed
    and the crimes of Samaria revealed.

    They practice deceit,

    Their sins engulf them;
    they are always before me.
