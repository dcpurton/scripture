    \nohang\vs{26}Then God said, ‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our
    likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in
    the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the
    creatures that move along the ground.’
  \end{hanging}

  \begin{poetry}
    \vs{27}So God created mankind in his own image,
    in the image of God he created them;
    male and female he created them.

  \begin{hanging}
    \nohang\vs{28}God blessed them and said to them, ‘Be fruitful and increase
    in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and
    the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the
    ground.’
