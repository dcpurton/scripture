\begin{scripture}[Hosea 6:11--7:1]
  \begin{poetry}
    \vs{11}For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed.

    When I would restore the fortunes of my people,
    \ch{7}when I would heal Israel,
    the corruption of Ephraim is revealed,
    and the wicked deeds of Samaria;

    for they deal falsely,
    the thief breaks in,
    and the bandits raid outside.
