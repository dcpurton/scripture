  \begin{scripture}[Isaiah 40:1--2]
    \begin{poetry}
      \ch{40}Comfort, comfort my people,
      says your God.

      \vs{2}Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
      and proclaim to her

      that her hard service has been completed,
      that her sin has been paid for,

      that she has received from the \textsc{Lord}â€™s hand
      double for all her sins.
    \end{poetry}
