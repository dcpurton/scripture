\begin{scripture}[1 John 1:8--2:2]
  \vs{8}If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is
  not in us. \vs{9}If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will
  forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. \vs{10}If we
  claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in
  us.

  \ch{2}My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if
  anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father---Jesus Christ, the
  Righteous One. \vs{2}He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only
  for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
