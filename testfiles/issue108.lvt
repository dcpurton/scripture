\begin{scripture}[Matthew 5:1--12]
  \ch{5}When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a hill and sat down. His
  followers came to him, \vs{2}and he began to teach them, saying:

  \begin{poetry}
    \vs{3}“They are blessed who realize their spiritual poverty,
    for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.

    \vs{4}They are blessed who grieve,
    for God will comfort them.

    \vs{5}They are blessed who are humble,
    for the whole earth will be theirs.

    \vs{6}They are blessed who hunger and thirst after justice,
    for they will be satisfied.

    \vs{7}They are blessed who show mercy to others,
    for God will show mercy to them.

    \vs{8}They are blessed whose thoughts are pure,
    for they will see God.

    \vs{9}They are blessed who work for peace,
    for they will be called God’s children.

    \vs{10}They are blessed who are persecuted for doing good,
    for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
  \end{poetry}

  \vs{11}“People will insult you and hurt you. They will lie and say all kinds
  of evil things about you because you follow me. But when they do, you will
  be blessed. \vs{12}Rejoice and be glad, because you have a great reward
  waiting for you in heaven. People did the same evil things to the prophets
  who lived before you.
