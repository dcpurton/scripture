\begin{scripture}[1 Corinthians 1:20--25]
  \vs{20}Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is
  the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the
  world? \vs{21}For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom
  did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was
  preached to save those who believe. \vs{22}Jews demand signs and Greeks look
  for wisdom, \vs{23}but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling-block to Jews
  and foolishness to Gentiles, \vs{24}but to those whom God has called, both
  Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. \vs{25}For
  the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is
  stronger than human strength.

    officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and
