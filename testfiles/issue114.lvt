\begin{scripture}[Colossians 3:1--14]
  \ch{3}Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on
  things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. \vs{2}Set
  your minds on things above, not on earthly things. \vs{3}For you died, and
  your life is now hidden with Christ in God. \vs{4}When Christ, who is
  your\footnote{\emph{3} Some manuscripts \emph{our}} life, appears, then you
  also will appear with him in glory.

  \vs{5}Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature:
  sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is
  idolatry. \vs{6}Because of these, the wrath of God is
  coming.\footnote{\emph{6} Some early manuscripts \emph{coming on those who
  are disobedient}} \vs{7}You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once
  lived. \vs{8}But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as
  these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.
  \vs{9}Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with
  its practices \vs{10}and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in
  knowledge in the image of its Creator. \vs{11}Here there is no Gentile or
  Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but
  Christ is all, and is in all.

  \vs{12}Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe
  yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.
  \vs{13}Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a
  grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. \vs{14}And over
  all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect
  unity.
