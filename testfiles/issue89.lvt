\begin{scripture}[Luke 21:1--7]
  \heading{The Widow's Offering}

  \ch{21}As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the
  temple treasury. \vs{2}He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper
  coins. \vs{3}‘Truly I tell you,’ he said, ‘this poor widow has put in more
  than all the others. \vs{4}All these people gave their gifts out of their
  wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.’

  \heading{Signs of the End of the Age}

  \vs{5}Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned
  with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said,
  \vs{6}‘As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will
  be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down.’

  \vs{7}‘Teacher,’ they asked, ‘when will these things happen? And what will
  be the sign that they are about to take place?’
