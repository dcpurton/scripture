    \ch{21}As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the
    temple treasury. \vs{2}He also saw a poor widow put in two very small
    copper coins. \vs{3}‘Truly I tell you,’ he said, ‘this poor widow has put
    in more than all the others. \vs{4}All these people gave their gifts out
    of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live
    on.’
