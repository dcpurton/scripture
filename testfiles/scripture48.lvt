    \vs{31}So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the
    glory of God. \vs{32}Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks
    or the church of God---\vs{33}even as I try to please everyone in every
    way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they
    may be saved. \ch{11}Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.

  \vs{2}I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the
  traditions just as I passed them on to you.
